KAI means sea in Hawaiian, Japanese and Native American. Started in 2020 by three young programmers to make their mark in the workplace and individual lives.

KAI is a website to support employees' mental well-being through grief, stress, anxiety, trauma and relationships.

We help organisations care for their employees' mental well-being, supporting them through grief, stress, anxiety, trauma and relationships. We enable them to take control of their lives allowing them to focus on what really matters on the job.
