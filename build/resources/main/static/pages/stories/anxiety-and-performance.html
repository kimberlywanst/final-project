              <em
                >The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the pressure on us, making
                many more people feel stressed, anxious and overwhelmed.</em
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              We can become irritated, tense, disinterested, affecting our
              performance and our ability to make sensible decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
              How to manage these emotions, control anxiety and create
              conditions that enable the maintenance of productivity and high
              performance, so demanded when facing these times of crisis, in
              business and in personal life?
            </p>

            <p>
              The first and main paradigm to be visited is that you are the only
              person who can do something about your emotions and direct them
              towards a result that adheres to your goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting from that point, we need to recognize our unique ability
              to exercise four gifts of human nature: Consciousness, that is,
              the understanding or knowledge that allows human beings to
              experience or understand aspects or the totality of their inner
              world. Self-awareness, a logical characteristic of the
              consciousness of being. There is no consciousness without
              self-awareness.
            </p>

            <p>
              Imagination, which, according to Philosophy, is the ability to
              combine images from experience in a new set, enabling the
              exploration of new future scenarios.
            </p>

            <p>
              And finally, the independent will that allows us to exercise
              choice, regardless of external conditions. From the exercise of
              these four gifts that only the human being has, we can create a
              space between a stimulus and the response, in order to exercise
              the freedom to choose the response that can best contribute to the
              achievement of the results we desire.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the words of Viktor Frankl, “There is a gap between the
              stimulus and the response. In this space lies our power to choose
              our answer. Our response lies in our growth and our freedom. ” –
              The sense of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create that space between anxiety and choose responses that
              increase our performance and ability to perform, I separate three
              mechanisms that can be useful:
            </p>

            <h5>1. Memories</h5>
            <p>
              I’m passionate about diving! I practice this sport from 1987. I
              dived in several places in the world, always looking for sharks,
              because they are animals that I admire and respect.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I notice that the level of anxiety and stress starts to
              increase, I do an exercise to rescue my memories of the thousands
              of dives I have already done.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is there a pre-pandemic memory that you remember when you are
              feeling anxious? What does this make you realize about your
              resilience? What is this helping you to see about the future?
            </p>

            <h5>2. Focus on what matters</h5>
            <p>
              A source of anxiety and stress is the pressure to fulfill an
              avalanche of requests that often give us the feeling of being very
              busy, but it does not always reflect how productive and effective
              we are.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is utopian to imagine that we can do everything and that we can
              meet all expectations and requests that come to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              How to do it, then to stay focused on what is important to achieve
              the goals and results we want?
            </p>

            <div class="actionable-steps">
              <h5>
                When a request arrives, ask myself: What quadrant does this task
                come from?
              </h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you come from Quadrant 1, you need to do something about
                  it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you come from Quadrant 3, you can decide to say no or
                  negotiate a better time to answer it with the person who
                  requested it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Coming from Quadrant 4, the question is up to you and just
                  exercise self-discipline to avoid succumbing to the escapes of
                  those who live so stressed and waste time on trivial things.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The focus should be on Quadrant 2, the renewal and
                  effectiveness quadrant. The more time you invest in Q2, the
                  less you will fall into the traps of the other quadrants.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <em

                >
              </p>
            </div>

            <h5>3. Connections</h5>
            <p>
              More and more, the demands of the present times demand a
              connection with ourselves and an investment of time and energy in
              self-knowledge. Only by understanding our values, priorities and
              purpose will it allow us to live in harmony with the legacy we
              want to leave and with the contributions we wish to make in the
              lives of the people we love and with society.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, neuroscience has pointed out that maintaining our
              relationships and the feeling of belonging to a group allows for
              greater longevity, a less stressful and healthier life.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have the ability to recognize stress and direct what it brings
              to achieve your goals, reaching levels of greater productivity and
              high performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: Chronic stress can cause serious health problems and, in
              extreme cases, death. Although the advice provided in this article
              can have a positive effect on reducing stress, it is only
              guidance, and you should seek advice from suitably qualified
              health professionals if you have any concerns about stress-related
              illnesses.
