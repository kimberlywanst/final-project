              <em>Grief is a normal part of the human experience. </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, every person will experience grief at some point in
              their life. With the chaos and uncertainty that exists in the
              world right now, many of us are faced with different kinds of
              losses. You may be grieving because you’ve lost your job, or
              haven’t been able to meet your friends or family in person, or had
              to postpone an important life event (for instance, a wedding).
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost all of us are facing the loss of normalcy. Those of us who
              have lost our loved ones may be having an especially hard time
              right now – as we may not even have the opportunity to follow
              normal grieving rituals and customs at this time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grief is the emotional, physical and psychological expression of
              loss, and it can cause intense physical and emotional suffering.
              Societal and cultural norms often influence ‘how’ and ‘how long’
              you should grieve.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, grief is a personal experience, and though you may have
              many well-wishers who share your pain, no one might be
              experiencing grief exactly like you do. You might be feeling anger
              and confusion, while someone else may be feeling sadness and
              shock. You may also differ in the time it takes you to overcome
              your grief – and that is completely okay. There is no right or
              wrong way to grieve; everyone grieves in their own way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even in the study of psychology, there are various models of grief
              that explain how people may experience loss. Let’s look at one of
              the more popular models that many people may relate to as they
              grieve.
            </p>

            <div class="actionable-steps">
              <h5>The Stages of Grief Model</h5>
              <p>
                This model was proposed by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in 1969. She
                explains that even though everyone may mourn their loss in a
                different way, people go through certain common stages. These
                stages are namely:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Stage #1 – Denial</li>
                <li>Stage #2 – Anger</li>
                <li>Stage #3 – Bargaining</li>
                <li>Stage #4 – Depression</li>
                <li>Stage #5 – Acceptance</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Let’s further explore what each of these stages mean.</p>
            <h5>Stage #1 – Denial</h5>
            <p>
              Denial is the first stage of grief. In this stage, people may find
              it difficult to come to terms with reality, and may try to reject
              the loss. They may feel like the world no longer holds meaning.
              Denial is a defence mechanism that is used to protect oneself from
              the shock of the loss. This is, most commonly, a temporary
              response and allows the person to pace their grief.
            </p>

            <h5>Stage #2 – Anger</h5>
            <p>
              As the reality of the loss sets in, one may feel intense anger or
              rage. Emotions of grief may manifest as anger. This anger may be
              directed towards inanimate objects, strangers, or family members;
              one might try to find someone or something to blame for their
              loss. At this stage, people may also feel guilty for feeling
              angry; this may cause further anger which this time is directed
              towards themselves. However, it is important to sit with this
              emotion. When we pay attention to anger, we will find that it
              dissipates.
            </p>

            <h5>Stage #3 – Bargaining</h5>
            <p>
              While processing grief, one may also find themselves bargaining
              for the loss to be recovered in some way. Bargaining is
              essentially a way of hoping that the situation was different.
              During this stage, one may end up blaming themselves for the
              things that happened or may ruminate and wish that things had gone
              differently. Bargaining is often a way to regain some sense of
              control, and is an attempt to protect oneself from the inevitable
              pain of the situation.
            </p>

            <h5>Stage #4 – Depression</h5>
            <p>
              Grief often involves intense sadness or depression. This is the
              most socially acceptable form of grieving. In this stage, one may
              withdraw from life, feel hopeless and numb and may have difficulty
              doing things. Even getting out of bed can seem difficult. The
              grieving individual may not want to be around other people during
              this time.
            </p>

            <h5>Stage #5 – Acceptance</h5>
            <p>
              Acceptance is the stage of grief where an individual finally comes
              to terms with the new reality around them and accepts that this
              reality is permanent. This is the stage where the person starts to
              feel more emotionally stable and is able to put back the pieces of
              their life and move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              These stages of grief do not necessarily unfold in a set or
              defined order. One may spend more time in one stage than the
              other, and sometimes even move back and forth between stages. More
              than being considered as distinct stages, they can be considered
              as common experiences that people may go through when they are
              dealing with loss. Not everyone may go through these stages,
              though. Some people may try to find meaning in their life after
              the loss. Others may move between coping with the loss and then
              coping with the effects of the loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter how you are grieving, it can be beneficial to use
              healthy ways to cope with grief – or at the very least modulate
              the intensity of the pain.
            </p>

            <h5>How to Cope with Grief</h5>
            <h6>Avoid things that ‘numb’ the pain</h6>
            <p>
              Coping through alcohol, overeating, binge-watching television, or
              oversleeping may seem to provide temporary relief from the pain
              you are feeling; however, in reality, these behaviours prevent you
              from processing important emotions and are likely to make you feel
              worse once the numbness wears off. Instead, sharing your feelings
              of loss and the memories you have allows you to release emotions
              and work through grief.
            </p>

            <h6>Surround yourself with people who care</h6>
            <p>
              Your support system can be a valuable resource for you to rely on
              in the face of loss and grief. Identify people you can lean on and
              reach out to them to talk about your feelings. If you feel that no
              one in your immediate circle will understand your situation, you
              can join an online grief support group or any other such group
              with individuals who are going through a similar experience.
            </p>

            <h6>Accept your feelings</h6>
            <p>
              You may experience a lot of different emotions as you come to
              terms with your loss. They are all normal and valid emotions.
              Don’t run away from emotions that seem overwhelming. Try to be
              accepting of your feelings and allow yourself to experience them.
            </p>

            <h6>Maintain a routine</h6>
            <p>
              Coping with your loss can be difficult and you may feel despair
              and a lack of control. Setting a new routine for yourself or
              maintaining your existing one can help you regain a sense of
              control and normalcy. Engage in simple tasks like housework,
              schoolwork or hobbies, run errands, and meet other people. Also
              prioritise your health and well-being. Eat healthy food, give your
              body adequate rest, meditate and try to exercise. This will help
              you become more resilient and can facilitate emotional healing.
            </p>

            <h6>Remember the positive memories</h6>
            <p>
              While you may be feeling low and may experience many negative
              emotions regarding the loss you are dealing with, it can be
              helpful to shift your focus to the positive memories that you had
              before the loss. You can schedule time in your routine where you
              reflect on your memories. You can do this while making yourself a
              warm beverage and this can even become a ritual that helps you
              cope with your loss.
            </p>

            <h6>Show yourself compassion</h6>
            <p>
              It may take you some time to come to terms with your present
              situation and not dwell on your past. That’s okay – you can take
              all the time you need; don’t rush the process. Dealing with grief
              is not a linear journey and some days may be better than others.
            </p>

            <h6>Seek professional help</h6>
            <p>
              If you’re feeling too overwhelmed by your emotions, consider
              seeking professional help to work through the grief. While it
              might be difficult for you to seek face-to-face therapy right now,
              there are a number of trained professionals you can connect with
              online who can help you develop strategies to effectively process
              the various emotions you may be experiencing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of
              self-awareness and strength. Every person is different in terms of
              how, when and what they do to process their grief. Remind yourself
              of this when you feel self-critical for not grieving in the
              ‘right’ or socially appropriate way. We hope these strategies help
              you feel better. Remember, all the emotions you are feeling are
              valid. Find ways to build a sense of stability and hope in your
              life, and don’t hesitate to reach out for support from loved ones
              or even a professional.
