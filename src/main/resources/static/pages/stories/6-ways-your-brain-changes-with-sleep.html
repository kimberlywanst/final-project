            <p>
              Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, it’s become more
              crucial than ever to get quality sleep. But our days — filled with
              change and uncertainty — can make getting a proper night’s sleep a
              challenge, to say the least. To plough through an ever-growing
              to-do list and inbox, many of us work into the wee hours, skimping
              on shuteye.
            </p>

            <p>
              In fact, 33% of Americans get six or fewer hours of sleep per
              night, according to a study in the journal Sleep. That’s at least
              one hour less than the seven hours per night you should get, as
              recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the
              National Sleep Foundation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Young people have an especially pronounced challenge because they
              need more sleep than adults: kids ages 6 to 12 need nine to 12
              hours of sleep per night, and teens ages 13 to 18 should get eight
              to 10 hours for healthy development.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yet, a GenYouth and Sleep Number survey found that teens are
              losing an average of 1.7 hours of sleep per night annually, with
              71% of middle and high school students suffering from sleep
              deprivation.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a culture, we’re still inclined to boast about our all-nighters
              as a proud testament to our productivity and commitment to work.
              But a preponderance of data shows in no uncertain terms that it’s
              nothing to brag about. A chronic lack of sleep brings about a
              whole host of physical, cognitive, and mental issues.
            </p>

            <p>
              It increases your risk of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and
              high blood pressure. It harms your memory, focus, and learning
              capacity. And sleep deprivation also wreaks havoc on your
              emotional state, exacerbating depressive symptoms, triggering
              anxiety, and amplifying irritability and aggression.
            </p>

            <p>
              So try trumpeting a good night’s sleep, instead, because the
              benefits to your brain are nothing short of astonishing. Start
              improving your life — and brain power — today by prioritizing
              quality sleep. Here are all the rewards you’ll reap:
            </p>

            <h5>1. Better Memory</h5>
            <p>
              Deep sleep (the stage known as slow wave sleep) consolidates our
              recent memories for long-term storage, according to recent
              research from the University of California, Riverside. The ability
              to quickly and accurately recall recent work-related information
              and conversations is vital to both individual productivity and
              workplace efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
              On a broader scale, our memories allow us to construct a cohesive
              sense of ourselves and our stories. Who are we if we don’t
              remember? As early 20th century Canadian novelist Lucy Maud
              Montgomery wrote in The Story Girl, “Nothing is ever really lost
              to us as long as we remember it.” Memory is crucial to our
              self-understanding and evolution. So save that work email for the
              morning and start your eight hour shift (of sleep) ASAP.
            </p>

            <h5>2. Boosted Creativity</h5>
            <p>
              Those who sleep eight hours per night are more than twice as
              likely to discover a more efficient way to complete a cognitive
              task, a study from University of Lübeck in Germany found. Most
              workplaces today prize employees with novel problem-solving
              skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fascinating research came out from Cardiff University in the U.K.,
              showing that REM sleep promotes creative ways of thinking about
              the memories we consolidate in non-REM sleep. Whatever dilemmas
              plague your brain long past bedtime, research proves you’re more
              likely to find your solution in slumber than in staying up past
              bedtime, when your brain functions less effectively and
              inventively.
            </p>

            <h5>3. Sharpened Focus and Concentration</h5>
            <p>
              Nothing slows the pace of your workflow like an inability to
              concentrate, and studies show bad sleep leads to a compromised
              ability to focus and make decisions. Who hasn’t experienced the
              embarrassment of offering dumb silence to a question lobbed at you
              in an early morning meeting after too little sleep?
            </p>
            <p>
              Our brains fail us after a sleepless night because we can’t
              properly regulate the parts of our brain associated with
              consciousness and alertness (the thalamus) and decision-making
              (the frontoparietal circuits). Sidestep this potentially large
              drop in productivity — and the resulting embarrassing blunders —
              by prioritizing quality sleep.
            </p>

            <h5>4. Stabilised Moods and Closer Relationships</h5>
            <p>
              Quality shuteye could improve your ability to handle stress, which
              Americans suffer from in record numbers. A 2017 Gallup Poll found
              that 8 in 10 Americans consider themselves stressed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Research out of the University of L’Aquila in Italy demonstrates
              that well-rested individuals are better able to regulate their
              emotions — they’re more adaptive and less reactive — and exhibit
              greater empathy toward others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sleeping well is an easy way to avoid interpersonal conflicts and
              stress, which aside from being detrimental to relationships, also
              cause disruptions to productivity.
            </p>

            <h5>5. Less Pain</h5>
            <p>
              If you suffer from chronic pain, as 50 million Americans do,
              according to the C.D.C., sleep may be your magic elixir. A new
              study out of the University of California, Berkeley showed that
              sleep deprivation increased reactivity in the part of our brain
              that processes pain (the somatosensory cortex), suggesting that
              better sleep quality might be a viable therapeutic model for
              managing pain. That’s a promising finding, considering that
              chronic pain adversely affects workplace productivity.
            </p>

            <h5>6. Lightened Anxiety</h5>
            <p>
              Chronic anxiety makes you almost six times more likely to
              experience problems with workplace performance according to
              research conducted at Ludwig Maximilian University in Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sleeping well by getting restorative REM sleep helps curb the
              effects of chronic anxiety, according to research from the
              University of California, Berkeley, which found that participants
              who were deprived of sleep for 24 hours experienced a 30 percent
              increase in anxiety the next day.
            </p>
            <p>
              With an ever-increasing number of us suffering from anxiety,
              especially those within the millennial and Gen Z demographics, the
              news that a good night’s sleep life can reduce anxiety — and
              provide a whole slew of benefits — should be welcome news.
